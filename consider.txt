Some files i am considering adding on the frontend
axios

components frameworks
antd, material Ui,


these are what were going to be adding to the dependencies when a user choose MUI
// "@emotion/react": "latest",
    "@emotion/styled": "latest",
    "@mui/material": "latest",

// this will be installed when a user selects ant design
     "antd": "^5.12.1",

to be added    
See the [FAQ](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/faq.md) and please add your own questions if you think they would help others.
