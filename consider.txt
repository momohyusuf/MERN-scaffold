Some files i am considering adding on the frontend
axios

components frameworks
antd, material Ui,


these are what were going to be adding to the dependencies when a user choose MUI
// "@emotion/react": "latest",
    "@emotion/styled": "latest",
    "@mui/material": "latest",

// this will be installed when a user selects ant design
     "antd": "^5.12.1",
